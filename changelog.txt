-Made the Seeker travel speed faster.
-Channeling proficiency can now increase even if weaves are ineffective.  (I promise you it will take forever if you dry-fire weaves all day and hope to advance, so don't use this method to try chain leveling.)
-Weave name will now show up in single player mode to help players who haven't learned the symbols yet.  (I forgot to add that to custom battle.)
Updated Features:
-Player will get additional XP after battles where they use channeling. This is in addition to the XP built into the channeling item that doesn't always give work as it should.  Players should be able to level their characters without ever touching a weapon now.

   -Note, some channeling code only seems to work in play-modes where respawns are supported.  (Deathmatch, Siege, etc.)
   -Note, starting gold is higher (3000) and bots are set to 65 per team.
   -If the stamina bar disappears when you die, press tab. Also, it may not show up perfectly until a bot respawns. I am not sure what causes this.
   -I have only tested Multiplayer using bots.  No real hosting, so I'm not sure how things will work in the real multiplayer realm.
   -If you are a channeler, get more gold to make your stamina recharge faster.
   -If you are a sul'dam, get more gold to have a higher chance of 'leashing' female enemy channelers. (Leashed channelers change side)
   -If you are a draghkar, get more gold to have a higher chance of giving the 'kiss of death' to enemies.
   -Code for additional warder spawns is de-activated for multiplayer.  As is the tweaked pathfinding code.  (Due to causing huge PC burden)
