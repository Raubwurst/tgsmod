Hey guys,

Before my last commit(Rev 53 or so) I was going through module_items and changed one of the books, as I thought it would be funny/interesting. Well, Vaerraent said it would be cool to put other books in aswell, so I decided to find some books to use. 

Well, the folks at dragonmount.com forums helped me out, and here is a list of the ones they gave me. Which ones do you think would fit in the game(overwriting the native books with the requirements and the couple with bonuses to stats)?
