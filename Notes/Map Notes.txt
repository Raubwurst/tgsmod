Every town, city or castle is colour-coded by faction, though not necessarily labeled. Small, soft circles are villages, the slightly bigger soft circles are towns and the hard circles are castles.

The map is not to scale - I've had to move continents closer together to get them all in to one map, as I don't think Warband could take a full scale one. 

I've tried to squeeze as many towns, cities and castles into Seanchan as feasibly possible. It'd be great for them to stage their invasion as part of the game script from those areas, and shows just how big Seanchan is. The Sea Folk/Amayar islands are kind of superflous, but I thought they'd be a nice addition to try to get some sea battles between Seanchan/Sea Folk in there. 

The Isle of Madmen is a good superflous area to have, providing a combat challenge to the higher-level players (with patrols of random rabble and rogue channeler armies but all lack boats.). A high-level or skilled player could board the Isle, work their way through the towns and cities and found their own kingdom while causing minimum effect to the story, with pretty much everybody thanking them for getting rid of a hostile (albiet not seaworthy so quite useless on the attack) kingdom.

I've added borders so we can examine the kingdoms in a birds-eye way, which will hopefully help us make sure that everything remains fairly balanced without detracting from the story too much. I'd love to hear your opinion on the faction splits. 

I'm thinking the Waste could do with a few more 'towns' and 'castles', especially since they now have Shara breathing down their necks.

If you can't think of enough good town names, I'll happily make some up or adapt exisiting ones for you!

And the red border around Shara would be great if you could implement it as an invisible (or visible) border blocking the player unless they go through one of the castle areas. Even better if you could trigger an attack ('war') on the player if they do. The cneter town and villages are supposed to be the channeler towns, that are isolated from everywhere else and a place nobody can leave or enter, especially not foreigners.
