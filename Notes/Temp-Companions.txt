Just some notes on the Companions:

There seems to be a slight bug in the dialogs somewhere. I'm only have sporatic success with the troops knowing how many weaves they really know.

If you want to do some testing, take a look at the last trigger in module_trigger.py.  This is my testing trigger that lets you add any troop to your party.

You have to modify the trigger a bit to get specific troops and numbers, but:

Press K to recruit troops.
Press J to change which faction's troops you will recruit.
Press O to get a ton of XP.
Press N to get gold.

I'll look into this some more tomorrow.  I think I understand how to use the repository.  Let me know if I got something wrong.  The only question I have is hot to make my new revisions show up as the latest.  Simply refreshing doesn't seem to do this.
